The second question is to do  a 2D SVM with streamlit deployment (3D plot) -dataset distributed on feature plane with a circle shape.
1.follow the constraints:
Generate 600 random points centered at the coordinates (0,0) with a variance of 10. Assign each point a label: Y=0 for points located at a distance less than 4 from the origin, and Y=1 for points at a greater distance. After generating and labeling the points, create a scatter plot visualizing the data.
2.follow the steps:
2-1. Calculate the distance of each point from the origin (0,0). 
2-2. Assign a label to each point: 
    2-2-1. Generate 600 random points with a normal distribution, centered at (0,0) and a variance of 10. 
    2-2-2. Y=0 if the distance is less than 4. 
    2-2-3. Y=1 if the distance is 4 or greater. 
2-3. Create a scatter plot showing the generated points where different colors distinguish labels Y=0 and Y=1.
3.output format:
3-1. A scatter plot image with the points labeled according to their assigned Y value. 
3-2. The plot should visually differentiate between points with Y=0 and Y=1 using distinct colors or markers.
4.Notes:
4-1.- Use appropriate libraries for generating random points and plotting (e.g., NumPy for data generation, Matplotlib for plotting).
4-2. Ensure the scatter plot is clear and the distinction between the classes is visually evident.

where is the streamlit deployment(3D plot)
-----------------------------
what if I revise the question ,  
generate 600 random points centered at (0,0) with variance 10, Y=0 for points in distance less than 4 and Y=1 for the rest. scatter plot

make x3=f(x1, x2) where f is a gaussian function. scatter plot 3d (x1,x2,x3)  with Y color

make a linear hyperplan (use light blue color) that can separate the points of Y=0, Y=1
-----------------------------
i wants to revise this problem again,

give me complete python code for :

Step 1. generate 600 random points centered at C1=(0,0) with variance 10, Y=0 for points in distance to C1 less than 6 and Y=1 for the rest. scatter plot
Step 2 generate another random points centered at (10,10) with variance 10, Y=0 for points in distance to C2 less than 3 and Y=1 for the rest. scatter plot
Step 3. make x3=f(x1, x2) where f is a Gaussian function. scatter plot 3d (x1,x2,x3) with Y color

step 4: make a linear hyperplane (use light blue color) that can separate the points of Y=0, Y=1
-----------------------------
this result is perfect, but can you add sliders that can change the values
1.Distance Threshold from 0.1 to 10.0
2.Semi-Major axis from 0.1 to 10.0
3.Semi-Minor axis from 0.1 to 10.0
-----------------------------
can you add another columns next to the interactive controls for the parameters, 
for the users to keying the values they want and the interactive controls will change to the values
-----------------------------
How can I dynamically update the plot?
the interative controls still not change withe the column inputs , but when i drag the control bar , the columns will change to the values of the control bar
-----------------------------
so the control bars cannot change while the columns has another values?
-----------------------------
ok then add the notations for the user to warn them that this two methods works seperately.
-----------------------------
can i add a reset button.
